# Merge chan:

- cannot be piped into => we can set needsDrain flag as we like
- cannot be sent into => we can be sure that drain event guarantees ability to send
- can be manually closed


### init:
  skip all closed chans
  add close listeners
  subscribe self.drain ~> turn()


### turn:
  while can send and can take:
    take timeout, or random chan if no expired timeouts
    send
  if cannot send:
    cancel all async takes
    set needs drain
    return
  else if cannot take:
    on all alive srcs, start async takes which call onTaken(value, src)


### onTaken(value, src):
  if value is CLOSED:
    return
  clear src's cancel function
  send value
  turn()
